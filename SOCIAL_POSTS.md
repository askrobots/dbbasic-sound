**Visual Setting:**
Medium shot of a developer in a casual hoodie or tech t-shirt, sitting at a clean desk with a laptop and professional microphone. Background shows a minimalist home office with soft lighting - maybe some plants, a few tech books on a shelf. Modern, approachable tech creator vibe. Camera slightly tilted for dynamic feel.

**Speaker Action:**
Person looks at camera with genuine excitement, gestures naturally while talking (maybe points at screen occasionally, uses hands to emphasize "free" and "48 sounds"). Energetic but not over the top - authentic enthusiasm.

**Script (under 9 seconds):**
"I just open-sourced a Python library that generates 48 royalty-free sound effects - from UI clicks to game sounds to alarm bells. All synthesized, completely free, MIT licensed. Perfect for prototypes or production. Link in bio!"

**Technical Notes:**
- Duration: ~8 seconds of speech
- Tone: Excited, informative, casual
- Background music: None needed (showcasing audio library)
- End frame: Could show waveforms or sound visualization briefly

**Alternative Shorter Version (7 seconds):**
"Made a free Python sound library - 48 effects including bells, clicks, game sounds, alarms. All synthesized, MIT licensed, ready to use. Check out dbbasic-sound on GitHub!"
